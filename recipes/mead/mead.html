    <h2>Mead:</h2>
    <p>Mead is the first known alcoholic beverage consumed by mankind and is believed to predate wine by nearly three thousand years. Today, mead is often referred to as 'honey wine' because the process of making mead and wine are so similar. The key difference is the use of honey rather than grapes as a source of sugar.</p>
    <h3>To make mead you will need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>750g of honey</li>
      <li>Sachet of brewer's or wine yeast</li>
      <li>Extra honey to bacl-sweteen</li>
      <li>25g of no rinse sanitiser</li>
      <li>Acid regulator</li>
      <li>Yeast nutrientes</li>
      <li>2 Campden tablets</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How-to-Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Sterilising</b>: As with all fermentation, it’s important to have a clean, sterile environment so the yeast grows, but nothing else does.

So, before you start, wash down your work space with warm soapy water. It's also a good idea to wash all your equipment in warm soapy water if you haven’t used it in a while. Read more about how to clean brewing equipment to keep your kit in tip-top shape.</li>

      <p><li>Making the mead</li></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add 5 litres of boiled water to the sterilised and rinsed bucket.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast nutrient and acid regulator, and stir to dissolve using the spoon.</li>
        <li>Now, add the honey to the boiled water and stir again until all the honey has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Leave the liquid to cool for a while so it doesn't damage or crack your demijohn, then transfer using the funnel.</li>
        <li>Leave your liquid to cool down to room temperature before pitching the yeast.</li>
        <li>Rehydrate your yeast according to the packet, and leave for 5 mins. Add to your demijohn and shake gently to mix.</li>
        <li>Add the airlock to the demijohn, fill the airlock with water and leave in a cool dark place where it won’t be disturbed for 2-3 weeks.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><p>How do I know if it's worked?</p></li>
        <p>You’ll know your yeast pitch was successful if after about 6 hrs, when gas starts to bubble out of your airlock. This is CO2, which is a natural by-product of fermentation, and the reason beer has bubbles in it.
As the fermentation progresses, you will notice a layer of sediment building up at the bottom of your fermenter. This is dead and dormant yeast, and is completely normal. It can be removed to increase clarity and taste.</p>
